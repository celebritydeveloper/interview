                    The work environment, I will be talking about the internal and external environment. Starting with the internal environment here in my organization, the environment has a negative impact on my productivity, the building and surrounding is unkept and not hygienic, it doesn’t have the prestige of a government parastatal, the convenience is messed up and staff are forced to go out outside to ease themselves, our cleaners are not much and the few do an haphazard job, and sometimes it makes staff to clean their space and also makes them resume duty late, when you go out to ease yourself, chances are you’ll be reluctant to come back to work and even if you do, you might have spent hours outside. Due to shared facilities, its easy for one to contact and infection. Lack of adequate stationeries in the office makes work difficult, chairs are bad, tables are bad, some staff don’t have a place to stay while some have been injured and it causes discomfort so the internal work environment doesn’t enhance productivity. Looking at the external work environment, there can political crisis and it cause insecurity, even around the office premises, there are security concerns and it also impacts productivity negatively. Limited economic activities also hamper productivity. The internal and external environmental factors as discussed about gives room for low productivity and performance.

                    Thank you very much ma, based on your answer, will your work environment affect your productivity, either negatively or positively?

                    I think more to the negative than the positive, in terms of hygiene it affects me, I can’t ease my self at work and my work place I think we are overstaffed and the facilities are over stretched that affects me as well. The power supply is very erratic and there is low funding for our generating set. When we come to work, we get very hot because we are in a tropical region and we are compelled to dressed to certain ways which needs a conducive environment to be okay.

              <p>
                    If promotion comes as at when due, it affects performance positively and motivates you to work harder, but when it has been due for a long time, it has a way dampening your morale, and even when it comes you’ll realize that the morale is too low to go up with just one promotion when you should have been promoted by twice or three times, it doesn’t take into cognizance the years that have been wasted, but if it does, I say yes, you can still be motivated. However, if promotion comes and the salary is not commensurate with the position, it demotivates you.

              <p>
                    Promotion is a sign of recognition of a job well done and that you’re ready to go to the next level, that alone is very good. Going into it properly, promotion amounts to monetary but if it is not commensurate, you will not be able to do your own work as a citizen or parent, though its good and I like it, but then again I wish that what we are earning was commensurate with the promotion. Am I motivated? The answer can be yes or no. Yes, because I am recognized for my work done, I am happy about that. I am also not motivated because of the other reasons I have given?

                    Thank you very much ma, to what extent can you say NHIS workers are satisfied with their job based on your interactions with your colleagues?

              <p>
                    I think a lot of persons have resigned to fate and are not expecting much anymore so we are just happy to have a job. But to say you’re satisfied, I don’t think they are. The reason for accepting their fate like that is because getting job in this country is difficult so you just have to be happy that you have a job whether the work environment is not conducive and the need facilities and tools are not there to work you’re expected by the top management to be happy. Even if you’re not satisfied nobody cares, because the things you need to work may not be provided as at when you need them. Being satisfied is a relative thing, deep down we are not, and we can’t do much about it.

Although I have undergone some few trainings but not as expected, the opportunity to develop yourself further. Recently, we are not permitted to go on paid study leave, which is affecting personal development. For all the above reasons, I am not satisfied.

                                                    I see it as a mindset thing, I believe that life is constantly changing, and to keep up with what’s happening you have to find ways to motivate yourself, therefore you have to move out of your comfort zone to do the things ordinarily you’re not motivated to do, just because it has to be done and there is no other person that can do it. Again, you’re earning experience whether you like it or not and those experience which you’re earning is also a transferable skill to other jobs. I will be the one to benefit from the experience and its one of the things that motivates me and keeps me on my toes.

                                                            There is no trust within management staff, between management. How can trust be built, we should have transparency, accountability, open or fair communication between management and staff, let the staff know that the management has us in mind and their decision is for our advantage, that way we’ll be able to open up and work. I think trust is mutually important, communication is really important between all cadre of officers in the organization, that alone is like reforming what we have and do. Making the work environment more conducive can also go a long way in motivating employees. Talking about transparency, a lot of times we think that things are hidden because we don’t know the true picture of things, so we’ll like for transparency to be there, and accountability as well. There is so much bureaucracy in the organization which is a civil service disease, if some bureaucratic doors can be broken a bit and make the organization more of a 21st century one, I think that way, it will be an employer of choice for people you’ll not be here because you want to be here and not just because you don’t have a job.

Tangible reward are the ones you can feel we call them salary raise, bonus, gifts, promotion, etc. these are things you hold and that’s a good reward system. The intangible reward which also goes a long to motivate you are feedback, when you have a good feedback of your work done, when you have acknowledgements, for instance, staff of the year or staff of the month, etc. Then  benefits are the advantage gained from something, like salary, prestige, exposure, etc. these are also the benefits. Something that gives you an advantage, like the benefit of working in a prestigious organization, the prestige you’ll get elsewhere.

However, that is not the case, even though there is a prestige as perceived by other people, but you that is there, you know that’s not the case. What do I mean by prestige? We are termed to be Federal Government workers, we should have certain advantages over others but those advantages are not there, for instance, our environment, the comfort in the environment is not there and that is minus to the prestige that we have. Also, the reward system, so far, the salaries are on time, which is a plus and it kind of motivates you. The bonuses do come, though not when due, but it comes and its okay. The feedback and acknowledgement, we don’t get much feedback and acknowledgement, but something started recently which is the best staff award and I believe more people will want that recognition. I believe if it continues, it will affect motivation.

As it is right now, given the level of reward or benefit, I am still motivated but to be motivated, I would like the growth opportunity.
                                                                                      </p>

                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                        </div>

                                                                                          <p>
                                                                                                I have given some other recommendations in our earlier discourse, when I talked about trust, accountability, communication and transparency. Most times the public sector is seen as the job for the government, so I don’t see ownership in the staff, I would like to see the government try to make the staff imbibe certain sense of ownership where we are seen as stakeholders in the government and what we do or do not do affect the productivity of the organization, that way, we’ll all have an impact in the organization. The government should find a way to imbibe those things into each and everyone of us, so that we can see ourselves as stakeholders in the organization and it would not be business as usual. Also, the kind of appraisal system here is a lot different from the private sectors and this affects our productivity, therefore, staff appraisal system should be reviewed as well.
                                                                                          </p>
