                    Six years in the public sector, Six years’ work experience. Thank you very much. We move straight to the interview, please ma take note that the interview is being digitally recorded for the purpose of this research. Thank you very much ma. Our first question is how does work environments affect productivity? First of all, we are looking at it generally how work environments affect productivity in the public sector?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">

              <p>
                    Work environment. This is a very important part of productivity and a lot of factors that affects work environment towards productivity. Now this can be external and it can also be internal, external in the sense that when you look at how our environment there are policies that guide our environments, government policies, apart from the government policies, we also have community laws, community laws that also guide people do this, don't do that, goo here, don't go there. Okay, let's leave the external factors. Let's go to the internal because this is where productivity really lies one when you look at a work environment, that is the work space where productivity really takes place. When you look at that environment, this is where determines how hard you work the output of a worker. The office environment has a huge impact on performance and productivity among employees.

                    Will your work place environment have an impact on your productivity?

            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">

              <p>
                    Let me give an instance, there was a day I came into the office and bin was not disposed, the area was messed up and I was supposed to attend to a client on my heels, so I needed to come up and pick up the files and solve the clients problem because it was really urgent, on getting to the office, the first thing I saw was the bin and dirt all over the place, I had to find a way to call the administrative officer in charge of the cleaners to find out if the cleaners didn’t come to clean, they informed me that the cleaners came and cleaned the office. First of all, that incident has taken part of my time, it has destabilized me, and also a client is on my neck so, emotionally I was not stable, it took me a while to be calm and settled to be able to attend to that client. Imagine if I had come and to the office and everything was in place, I would have had the time to sit down and look at the client’s file, walk through what I needed and get back to the client at the shortest possible time, in this case it will increase my productivity because I will work when I am supposed to and ditch out what I needed for the client and attend to him instead of coming in and getting angry over an unkept bin.
              </p>
              <p>Now let's look at electricity in this part of our society, in this part of the world. We have a huge problem of electricity, in an office where a worker needs to work, with computer, there's no lights. What do you do this brings you down every day you go to work, you want to maybe put in data into your system, this is the 21st century and you still see people using, paper and pen keeping information. This is not right. You need to maybe transfer information from one region to another and you, you keep on using pencil paper. This is not right in this period. We need computers to send that information within minutes. It’s a digital age we are in but we find out that there is no lights, even if there is light, maybe the current is low.</p>
              <p>These are issues. when you see this thing, this thing causes employees to have headaches, you have inability to focus it even causes drowsiness, when there is no lights. Let's go to, another factor we have temperature. This is a very hot part of the world and I don't know if there is a law enforcing a reasonable temperature in an office setting, but in Nigeria, the public sector offices are very hot. We don't have a stable temperature in our offices. Most of our offices operate without air conditioners and people are expected to dress officially to office they put on their suits, coats, and tie, which in a very hot temperature. I don't know how people are expected to work in this kind of environments. It's not suitable you, you tend to make mistakes. This decreases productivity, inability to focus. You lack motivation to complete your task. Now, let's move to another fact. This is noise, people don't really know this but noise is a source of stress. Many people go through stress, which they don't know that this is the cause. Some of our offices are located in a very noisy area. These days many people experience stress. This makes working drowsy because maybe you're trying to concentrate on something, but your mental alertness is been disrupted because of noise.</p>
              <p>This makes work drowsy and you're fatigued, you're unable to contribute your increase to productivity. It also brings up health issues, blood pressure, heart diseases it brings it up because you are not in a cool environment where you're supposed to be thinking effectively. Now, another factor that also affect our office environment is humidity, humidity is something that is a problem we experience in this part of the world. For example, we have offices that are being, located in a swampy area and what we see is water logged area. This affects the building and as years goes by it starts growing mote inside the office and if the office space is not big enough, there is no good air ventilation and the next thing we start experiencing is mote growing on the walls. And when this mote starts growing, employees who work in this kind of space starts developing health conditions.</p>
              <p>First, you see them being sluggish at work, some feel drowsy. These affects their health. And if it's not managed, this mote starts breeding different kinds of diseases like skin irritation, lung infection, asthma, dust mites, etc these are very dangerous things that affect our office spaces, which our government is not doing anything about it. Let me link this particular part to our government policies, they don't do anything about our lands to stop this growing of mote this, this water logged areas. When there is flood it affects houses. This is where mote starts growing and this is affecting our generations. People start developing health problems from a very tender age that by the time they get to adult age I don't think they have anything to add to productivity.</p>

                    Thank you very much ma for that wonderful answer and response, moving to the next question, you've taken your time to look at the factors that will cause work environment to affect productivity at a very good space. Now coming to you now individually and looking at the environments where we are now, will your workplace environment have an impact, in your own productivity ma?

              <p>
                    I talked about electricity, I talked about office equipment, I don't know if I mentioned that, these are very vital tools needed in an office, whereby these are not in place you need to send down information to another office or you need to keep your data in place. You don't have these tools to help you manage your job. This makes you develop headache because you don't know what to do. Maybe you put them down in a paper and all of a sudden somewhere they want you to transfer information that is when you start looking for fuel to provide an electricity for your office? It is not right; this is affecting our productivity; you are being rushed. This is brain drain. Our work is not supposed to drain us we're supposed to enjoy our jobs because it is something that is supposed to provide satisfaction, but we are not getting it.

                    So, in other words, you're saying that workplace environment will really have an impact on your productivity negatively. Thank you very much Ma for that wonderful answer, moving to the other session of the question. Will promotion of employees affect productivity generally in the public sector?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">
              <p class="h6 participant badge badge-warning">Participant 10:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                    Yes. We all come from different walks of life, we all have our different ideologies, guiding us, promotion generally where you promoted you're happy and there are good things that come with promotion and if these good things come with it, nobody that will not be happy and you want to give your best. Even though you're at home and somebody is making you angry, you'll just throw that away and you feel happy. It's takes you a long way for a very long time. You feel happy and proud that you have been promoted. Productivity will increase. So, promotion is a very important part of human resources of employees. You have to promote your workers for them to give you their best. Every organization wants the best in its productivity. So, when you want your best you have to promote your workers. This is the basis of happiness. People want to be promoted. It's makes them feel elevated, proud, happy. What else do you want in life? You want to be happy?

              <p>
                    Thank you very much ma. So, ma to you will promotion have any effects on your own work performance? If yes, can you explain how and what it will do to you, when promoted?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                    The word promotion connotes happiness. When you're been promoted, even if you were down before, you'll go and meet your boss and say sir, do you have any job for me? You will suggest things that I've been hiding somewhere, you would want to give your best to the organization, you'll even suggest or come up with good ideas, positive ideas to promote productivity in your office. Promotion is a very good strategy for management to improve their work productivity.

                                Promotion will, affect your productivity positively, does it matter when it's comes or does it have to come at the right time for your performance to be affected? Because a lot of people say as long as they know that promotion would come, even if it doesn't come at the right time, there is still performance. So, which can you say is yours? Does it affect your performance when it doesn't come at the right time or it reduces your performance because it doesn't come at the right time.

In this part of the world we are been faced with poverty, poverty affects us so much that sometimes If you don't have a job, you think, how do you feed and maybe you have a family depending on you what do you do? And you have a job and there's no promotion, lack of promotion will not affect, my work performance definitely it will come because our government's policies, we know sustainability is not something that is being managed properly in our government policies, because every government that comes tend to want to put his own ideas into place, we know these things doesn't come fast. So, lack of promotion should not affect your job performance. It should not affect it.

                                You've moved to the other part where I was going to ask you to explain the impact of promotion on your motivation level. So what impact will lack of promotion have on your motivation level?
                          </p>
                        </div>

                                Yes. If you're not promoted, you feel you're being demoralized, but only for a time being because life goes on, you have to move on with life. So, it should not be something that will affect my motivation for a long time. Let's look at it this way initially when you don't get the promotion and your financial needs are increasing daily, you'll be demoralized. Your effectiveness at work decreases. Maybe you were given a job to do, you'll be sluggish. Like we normally say it is a government work. Why are you stressing yourself too much on it?
                          </p>
                          <p>Your attitude to work is reduced. You don't, put that kind of impact that you want to give the office you want to reduce it so it also reduces your motivation level.</p>

                                Thank you very much ma. Moving to the next question to what extent are NHIS workers satisfied with their job. I know that you might be having discussions with your colleagues in way or the other you must have heard the way they talk. How they feel about their job? Do you think NHIS workers are satisfied with their jobs?
                          </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">

                                <p>
                                        The answer is still linked back to our society, looking at our society we are facing abject poverty. So, we tend to say we are satisfied. Meanwhile, generally we are not really satisfied. I want to take this a little bit further. Satisfaction, when you say satisfaction there are many things that comes with satisfaction, monetary as in financial benefits that come at the end of a work period. Office materials, equipment, etc. We are not really satisfied with our job because when you look at your financial demands, your job, your output, is more than what you get in return at the end of the month. You're not satisfied with your job; your needs are more than what you're giving. This is not satisfaction.

I cannot give a 100% to a working environment where most things demoralize you, there are a lot of things that are not in place. We have lack of lack of competency, lack of funds, many issues that are affecting our jobs. So, you cannot give it a 100% when these things are not in place, although we are hoping that it will get better but for years, it has not gotten better. It's even getting worse. So, we are hoping it will get better if we get a better government we are hoping it will get better. Because if more funds are put into this sector of the economy, I think it should get better.

You've rated your level of satisfaction at 50% can you not say your level of motivation is on the same level? With your level of satisfaction? Can you explain further?
                                                                      </p>

Because every day you wake up, you're happy, you want to be happy, and you have to be happy. So, it's from within, it shouldn't affect the job productivity. You accepted the job, so you have to give it your best. You don't have to wait for somebody to offer you something before you now start giving your best. Your best has to come hoping that God will make it better.

And for that to happen, it means that they have to be 100% performance from the side of the employee themselves. In that case, employees need to be more motivated. To round it up let's say more satisfaction leads to more motivation, more motivation leads to more performance while more performance will lead to more productivity, which the organization wants to attain? Now can you suggest ways that you can be more satisfied to at least you said a 50% to at least move higher from this 50% to maybe a 90, 99 or 100% to be able to give in your 100% performance. So, can you suggest ways where you'll be more satisfied.
                                                                                  </p>

It’s a reward. What is reward? Reward is the recognition you get during service for your efforts that you gave. These can be seen in the allowances and your salary, cash rewards, awards that have been given these are rewards. Let’s look at benefits, it’s what you gain after service, like our gratuity and pension at the end of your service period. These, have been very huge impacts in our motivation. Like when somebody is looking for a job, there are two factors you have to look at, private sector and the public sector. Yes, the public sector people want to go for the public jobs because we have job security, these job securities, goes with gratuity and pension. But when you look at the private jobs, most of them don't go with these, so people don't want to work in the private sector leaving the government work.
                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                        <p>
                                                                                                A lot of people vying to work there and less jobs for them. This is not good for the society. We need people also in the private sectors, were they really need to give their full impacts, but these private sectors don't offer these incentives as in this reward of pension gratitude. So, when people are looking for jobs they want to see if it has this pension gratuity. Rewards are things that people are always looking out for, these benefits. There are things people always look out for. It has a very huge impact to play on staff motivation if they're looking for job and even while at the job, if these benefits are not there, they don’t give their best and still look out for another job. Everybody's looking for a Greener pasture. This greener pasture is seen with rewards and benefits.

Moving to the last phase of the question, you've mentioned quite a few types of reward that can motivate you, gifts, promotion that comes with financial benefits, bonuses and cash rewards. So, will the level of reward and benefits affect your level of motivation because with what you’ve mentioned, from the previous interviews I have had with other participants, they made me to understand that most of them might be expecting a particular kind of reward at that time because of a particular need that needs to be met at that particular time. When the one you expect or desire for doesn’t come will it affect your level of motivation?
                                                                                                  </p>

You want some source for what will satisfy your personal needs at that moment so your motivation is not really there, so it will really affect your motivation.

Let me go to this area when you do a job and you’re not rewarded financially. It drops your motivation. You tend to be angry. I mean use the word angry because you expected a financial reward. I said our level of poverty over here is very high and your outputs does not meet your needs, you want to go out elsewhere to get what you really want to meet those your needs, your motivation, it's on that productivity decreases. It's less. You can't give your 100%. You have to take it out elsewhere. You can't you really put it down there. The management of most of our offices need to look into this aspect, is a very vital aspect of any workplace. Motivation increases staff productivity because when there's no reward, there's no happiness and it decreases your performance. The psychology is just written all over you. It decreases your motivation.

Lastly if I may ask you to make recommendation on the issue of staff motivation in the public sector, what recommendation would you like to make or should we put it this way? If you're put in a position to change things on issues that affects motivation in the public sector what will you do? Or in what way will you like the government to improve on staff motivation in the public sector?

Though, it may not meet your needs. Like I always say, you have to look elsewhere? It’s tough to give you it's best, you have to keep in down there with allowances. They look forward to the allowances more than their salary, so that they can use it to meet one or two of their needs. The allowances are very important. Staff recognition, staff work should be recognized? Some will say, after how many years I have been working nobody even recognizes me for what I have done. This is bad, it decreases motivation. Even though there are no cash benefits associated with this recognition, it's also motivates them. So, it's increases their motivation, they feel happy. Everyone’s personality is being spread everywhere. So that will be recognized. So, for a staff to be recognized by management, it means a lot to them.
