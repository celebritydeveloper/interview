                    12 years, in the public sector, that’s a lot of experience which will help our Interviewer session. Moving to the first question ma, how does work environment generally affect productivity?

                    The work environment is very important, its one of the basic aspects that affects productivity, its an aspect that any organization or employer of labour needs to put in place make sure its properly set for whoever is coming to work for them. Take for instance, in a manufacturing organization, especially where food is been produced, the environment should be conducive enough for the workers to carry out their job, make sure its clean and hygienic enough for them, it also motivates them to work better and while they are motivated, it increases their output which is their productivity, so, I think work environment is one vital aspect every employer needs to put into consideration.

                    When we talk about public sector in Nigeria, its one cardinal issue government needs to consider, we tend to see more of the private sector putting that in place than the public sector, it is one issue that the labour union makes sure they advise the government concerning the conduciveness of the work environment. Talking about working facilities, for instance, when you go to some ministries to do a job, the all place is choked up sometimes, there are no air conditioners and even when there are air conditioners, it is not been maintained and some are dysfunctional and the employees are not satisfied. The work environment is one issue the government needs to improve upon because when the place is conducive it helps you to think very well, helps you to solve problems, helps you to even communicate well with clients and to proffer solution to their needs. In terms of neatness, the government needs to review it as well because the cleaners employed are not even doing their jobs properly, when you get to the office you find out that it was not properly cleaned even the conveniences are not properly cleaned.

              <p>
                    Ma, if I can take you back, all these things you’ve mentioned how can they affect productivity, like the office equipment, good ventilation, air conditioners, hygiene, etc if they are in place will they affect productivity?

              <p>
                    First and foremost, a sane mind brings out productivity, so, when you get to an office and the environment is conducive, you find out that you’ll work and think properly, and the tendencies for your productivity to increase, you’ll put in more into the organization because there is no hindrance to your comfort, it will limit complaint and you’ll find out that you’re more productive.

                    Let me give an instance, there was a day I came into the office and bin was not disposed, the area was messed up and I was supposed to attend to a client on my heels, so I needed to come up and pick up the files and solve the clients problem because it was really urgent, on getting to the office, the first thing I saw was the bin and dirt all over the place, I had to find a way to call the administrative officer in charge of the cleaners to find out if the cleaners didn’t come to clean, they informed me that the cleaners came and cleaned the office. First of all, that incident has taken part of my time, it has destabilized me, and also a client is on my neck so, emotionally I was not stable, it took me a while to be calm and settled to be able to attend to that client. Imagine if I had come and to the office and everything was in place, I would have had the time to sit down and look at the client’s file, walk through what I needed and get back to the client at the shortest possible time, in this case it will increase my productivity because I will work when I am supposed to and ditch out what I needed for the client and attend to him instead of coming in and getting angry over an unkept bin.

              <p>
                    Definitely, because my mind will be sound to work for that day, and even where my intellect is needed, it will be in place to ditch out whatever is required. So, definitely a good work environment will increase my productivity.

                    Thank you very much ma, will promotion of employees affect productivity generally?

              <p>
                    Everybody likes to be acknowledged so I feel generally, promotion is one aspect when it comes to increase in productivity, because it will stir up people, it will make them happy to work more for the organization, because it shows that your work and input in that organization is been appreciated and recognized, because once a worker puts in the number of hours, efforts, intellect and strength it is very necessary to appreciate them by way of promotion, see how you can increase their salaries and allowances and the employee will actual see that the organization appreciates and recognizes his work.

              <p>
                    Will promotion have an effect on your own work performance, I have been able to Interviewer some participants and some say that so long as promotion will come even if it doesn’t come as at when due, they will still be motivated while others are of the contrary opinion, So, to you ma, will promotion have any effect on your job performance, whether it comes or not?

              <p>
                    Definitely it will have an effect either positively or negatively, depending on how you’re looking at it, I have worked for 12years like I said earlier and when I started, working I started at Level 9 being a graduate, after 3years I expected to be promoted to the next level, so, I found out that due to some circumstances it wasn’t forth coming and we were suppose to have a promotion exam, have an oral Interviewer to determine whether you’ll be promoted to the next level, but we found out that we are not hearing anything concerning the promotion. As an individual, I wasn’t happy, regardless of the fact that you have a job, you also want to grow, which is very vital, even if you have a child at home that is a year old, and in the next year you’re expecting to see your child grow normally as a two year old and possess whatever a two year old child possesses, so its same thing when it comes to work environment, and I expected that after three years, I am supposed to be promoted, to the next level and mentally I am already looking at an increment in my salary, increment in my allowances and I already have a mental picture in my head already of moving to a new office and being a boss to someone else, am also going to fill in another capacity and work in another unit depending how the promotion comes, so, based on my expectations I was spurred to work more, but at that point when it didn’t come, I couldn’t start telling you how I felt, it slowed me down and I was discouraged and I had to talk myself out of it and decided to keep going hoping it will come one day. So, when you’re promoted, it means you’re been recognized and you’ll be happy at your job and you’ll put in more into the job which will automatically increase productivity.

              <p>
                    Okay ma, from what you’ve said, in that case when the promotion did not come as at when you expected did your work performance drop or for the fact that you were expecting it and you know it will come did the work performance continue or it dropped?

              <p>
                    It actually dropped a little, because it’s a different case if you get informed about it or hear that the board is discussing about it or that the government is looking into, you know that keeps your hope alive, but whereby you’re not hearing anything about it, its as if nobody even is concerned about it or seeing the fact that these people are due for promotion, it actually got to me at a point, I had to after a while talk myself out of it and decided to continue with the work.

                        Thank you very much ma, can you explain further, the impact of lack of promotion, I know from what you’ve said, you’ve been able to give us some hints on the effects of delayed promotion so, what effects will lack of promotion in an organization have your performance and motivation level?

                  <p>
                        Let’s start by asking what is motivation? It has to do with what actually propels you to do more, what gingers you and what triggers something inside of you to give more and promotion is one of the motivational tools that is been used in any organization, for myself I feel is something I am entitled to, it is part of the conditions of service and part of what motivates me is promotion apart from increment in salary, increment in allowances, introducing health insurances that takes care of your family health care. When you get home and tell your spouse, honey, I have been promoted, you know it makes you feel good and you give in more hours to work, when you wake up in the morning, you prepare and go to work early, but when promotion is not forthcoming, because its something you look forward to, lack of it will definitely reduce your motivation level, for myself, it definitely reduced it because this is something I expected but it wasn’t forthcoming, I was demotivated and when I wake in the morning I tend to sleep back and say to myself I don’t need to go to work that early, I start giving excuses, even attending to clients I will just tell them to come back the next day even when it’s something I can handle that same day. It actually reduced my motivated level.

                            Thank you very much ma, moving to the other phase of the question, to what extent do you think NHIS workers are satisfied with their jobs based on your interactions with your colleagues, on a scale of 10% to 100%?
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        For job satisfaction here, I will give it 40%. There are certain issues in the office that needs to be put in place and the way its going, its making people put in less effort in the job. For instance, we have issues with our furniture, the ones bought are of inferior quality, when things like this comes in they expect us to use it for certain number of years before they consider changing them, but you find out that this things doesn’t even stay up to a year before they start having issues and people will no long have a place to sit down to do a work and making workers go out of their way to buy chairs for themselves, out of the small salary they are even managing to eat with, so, when you look at things like this, and you find out that this contract of buying this furniture are being given to people who tend to collect a lot of money for them and spend a little to buy those things. They bring inferior furniture and supply the whole offices and it’s a very serious issue presently on ground that makes people not to come to work. If they come, they just roam around and turn the office to a gossip centre, coming to gist and go back home, and clients too find it difficult to get a proper seat to sit down and its one cardinal thing that has really made people not to be happy about the job and they are not satisfied about the job at all. Yes, we are happy that we have where we go every morning to work and what gives us money at the end of the month but still we’re not satisfied about the job. Take for instance, our rest rooms are really appalling, we have to come to work and find a way to go and use the restroom outside, look for an eatery or bank to use the restroom, that means it takes us out of the office and you cannot determine when nature will call, so, imagine when am attending to a client and I need to use the rest room instead of just walking into the restroom and tell the customer to give you just two or three minutes, you’ll be back but you need to go all out, so are you suppose to leave the customer there, so, these are two of the numerous issues that affect our job satisfaction.

                                    First, this job is something that I love doing, that the basis for the satisfaction, not like am doing it just for the money, it’s something I love doing, I get paid when I am supposed to be paid which helps me to fulfil my needs back home. Fairly, the cleaners are doing their job to an extent at least, I thank God still have a seat am sitting on and the environment is a bit conducive for me to attend to client.

                                        Yes it does, why I said it varies sometimes, if one is not properly satisfied, you find out that you’re not been motivated to do the job, due to lack of promotion, salaries not been paid on time, you’re not been recognized as you should, the environment is not so conducive, but of recent I was promoted that is why I said I varies, so the promotion boosted my motivation level and I found out that I became more motivated to do the job and give it my best, but you know sometimes when what you’re supposed to get or what you’re supposed to be recognized with is not forthcoming you find out that the motivation level reduces, like when the promotion is supposed to come and it didn’t come, it actually reduced my motivation level.

                                                            Okay ma, I have been able to Interviewer other participants and from our Interviewer, some are intrinsically motivated which means their motivation comes from within and it has nothing to do with their level of satisfaction, like you said earlier you love your job and you’re grateful that you have a job, which is what 90% of my participant have already said they love their job and grateful for their job, so I want to know are you intrinsically motivated or extrinsically motivated?

                                                    Yes, it matches with it, in as much you can’t say it will continue to be like that, that’s why I said it varies sometimes, because its not something you’ll say it has to flow like that. For the number of years I have been here, I have noticed that sometimes it’s high and other times its low, depending on the situation and the circumstances at the particular time.

                                                        Thank you very much ma for the answer, we know that every organization aspire to gain a 100% productivity and we also know that productivity cannot be 100% when performance is low, and performance cannot be high when motivation and satisfaction is low, so, they are all interconnected in one way or the other, as you rated your level of satisfaction as 55% and your level of motivation varies depending on the circumstances at that particular time. Ma, I would like you to suggest more ways you can be more satisfied to at least attain at least 99% or 100% so that your performance and productivity will increase, so can you suggest ways you would like to be more satisfied with your job?

                                                        I actually wish that this Interviewer will be listen to by our government or our employer, so that they will know where and where they will make adjustment. Promotion should come as at when due, fixtures, fittings, office equipment, office appliances are in place so it doesn’t hinder us from carrying out our job, for some time we didn’t have a photocopier and you know we need it because we have documents that we need to make photocopies of, so most times we take the job our to make photocopy which is not so good, because from there it could make the organization to be porous and people might get to see confidential documents or even make a copy of the documents and before you know it documents are all over the place so appliances are supposed to be put in place for you to work and carry out your job effectively. Then also, when it comes to the air conditioners, fans, etc. they should be in order and the environment should be neat and well taken care of, where grasses are meant to be cut they should be, and where needs mopping should be mopped because sometimes in the public people tends to use sentiments when it comes to giving people jobs, so sometimes some cleaners can’t actually work well, sometimes you employ old women who you intend to help but later finds out that they can’t do the job as they supposed to, instead of employing them you can ask them if they have a daughter or a niece who can help them do the cleaning so that the job can be done properly. Then allowances paid as at when due is also very vital. Policies should be favourable to workers as well, it shouldn’t be something workers will threaten to strike or cause industrial disharmony.

                                                        What is reward? Reward is a thing given in recognition of service or effort or achievement, reward can be in several form like allowances, awards or even cash reward given to a worker to appreciate or recognize a job well done, when a worker is rewarded its instantaneous its something that you do right now not futuristic, I think some months back we had this employee of the year award which is something that also motivates staff, now everyone will look forward to it because the staff that was given the award had an action with our Board Director, Chairman and was given quite a recognition and you know everybody felt as if they were the one that was given the award, and it will motivate other staff to work hard so as to gain the recognition, because you don’t know what being recognized will bring for you tomorrow, its something you’ll also add to your curriculum vitae. Benefits is like an advantage or a profit gained from something, its something that is futuristic. Like the in the public sector here in Nigeria, we know that we have what is called the pension scheme afterwards, you know that you have a trust fund which you can look forward to after working for 35years, its not like going back to nothing, but you know there is something set aside for those number of years for you to fall back on, if you have an idea on something you can invest the money that will bring profit for you, you know that lump sum to invest, so, when you’re being paid your retirement benefit, and if they review it in a way that it’s something tangible, something you can actually hold on to and say yes you can actually fall back on when you stop working, the same thing when it comes to health scheme, some public sectors have a very good health scheme where their family will have ease of access to health care facilities even after retirement you’re still entitled to some of these facilities, its actually motivates you to give in your best, because your best years is what you’ve given so once you’re retired you know that you don’t have that strength to actually work but you put in more years now because you know that there is something you’re looking forward to after retirement.

Also, when you’re been awarded, it shows that somebody is actually looking at your performance and your input into the company, that means someone is appreciating you as an individual in the organization so, that will increase my motivation level.

Everybody needs it because you can’t go to the market and not have your legal tender which is the naira to pay for the goods you need. It motivates you anywhere in the world be it black or white, you’re motivated when it comes to cash rewards.

Now that I have been promoted it increased my motivation by 100% and imagine now that they are talking about minimum wage increment, as soon as it is signed into law and been gazetted, you will find out that it will definitely for myself increase my motivation level because there will be more money to give my family a better and quality life.

                                                                              </p>

Government also needs to think of a way to make sure that they set up an easy way of getting those benefits, because we find out that retirees tend not to get their benefits as at when due so some structures needs to be put in place and that is where the technology thing comes in to place, if proper records are been kept not just in hard copies but also in soft copies, you’ll find out that it will easy to know people’s entitlement and there will be no signing and moving around offices, most times a lot of retirees die before they get their retirement benefits.
