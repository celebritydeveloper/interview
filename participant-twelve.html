                    Going straight to the question, how does work environment affect productivity generally?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">
              <p class="h6 participant badge badge-warning">Participant 12:</p>

              <p>
                    Work environment can affect productivity positively or negatively because the work environment is like a laboratory where a job is been carried out, so, the laboratory depends what comes out of it, so, what I am saying is that a good working environment aids good productivity because a good working environment should have some certain qualities, a good working environment should be spacious, quiet, clean and with good working equipment and facilities to aid good and effective productivity, but without all these in place, I don’t think anything good can come out, again the most important is that the temperature of your work place should be conducive, you can’t expect someone to do very well in a hot environment, all the working facilities should be in place and in good working condition to make the employee comfortable while doing his job, with that you’ll expect more from the employee because he is well relaxed and comfortable so he/she will do better in such an environment. Also, when there is less noise, there is no distraction and when there is no distraction, the worker will be well focused on his job and concentrate more and get more ideas because when you’re working on something, you think out good ideas but in a noisy environment, you’ll be distracted and you’ll not get good ideas on what you’re doing so I think the working is a very important factor of productivity.

              <p>
                    Okay. Sir, we are looking at the public sector, can you relate all these answers to the public sector, you have five (5) years work experience in the public sector, how do you think work environment is affecting productivity in the public sector?
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">
              <p class="h6 participant badge badge-warning">Participant 12:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                    The work environment in the public sector is not really encouraging because anything that has to do with the government people don’t have time for it, the facilities and equipment in most cases are not really working so you don’t really expect the best from people working in such environment. In the public service working environment, you’ll only find very few offices that are conducive for working and most of them do not really have a good working environment because they lack the qualities of a good working environment like I mentioned earlier, the ventilating system, fan, very comfortable tables, chairs, and again when you don’t have a good chair it affects your health that’s one thing people don’t really know because you sit down for a long time in a particular position when you’re not really comfortable, it affects your health, so the public sectors don’t really have a conducive working environment and should be looked into if they really want the best out of their workers. I have been to severally offices since we are also colleagues, its more like the same thing everywhere just some few exceptions.

                    Thank you very much sir. Going further, personally how do you think your own work environment can have an impact on your productivity?

              <p>
                    Yes, we are all human beings and we’ve seen how the it is, it is left for you to make your own work environment suitable and convenient for you, like myself I try as much as I can to make my working environment convenient and suitable for me, so that I can be focused and again because it’s a public office and you have people coming in and out, sometimes you have to schedule yourself for any task, especially things you have to concentrate on, I can’t say my office is conducive because it doesn’t possess all the requirement for a good working environment but, I try as much as I can to make my working environment convenient for me, so that I will be focused and do well in my job and come out with a good result.

              <p>
                    Does your work environment have any impact either negative or positive on your work performance and how productive you’re to the organization?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">
              <p class="h6 participant badge badge-warning">Participant 12:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                    Yes, of course it really have a negative impact, I won’t say positive because the positive part like I told you, I create that part for myself because I try to make it conducive for me, but the negative part, you know the noise, the temperature of the office, you know here in Nigeria we don’t usually have light all the time and the government is not ready to fund or service our generating set to give us 24hours power supply or 8hours light like we are supposed to be working so, you can’t be working in a very hot environment, because of the hotness of the environment, you cannot be much productive, so the working environment is not really conducive and not encouraging for productivity. As discussed earlier I try to make it convenient for me because it is a job and am being paid for it and I have to deliver, when we received our appointment letters and then we wrote letter of acceptance, they told us some certain things like how to work under pressure and difference conditions, so, we accepted it so we should be able to cope, every good worker should come up with his/her method of making things happen for himself and the organization which he/she works in though it’s not encouraging.

              <p>
                    Thank you very much, that illustration has given us an in-depth reasoning to the answer. Moving to the next phase of the question, will promotion of employee affect productivity generally?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                    Yes, promotion will definitely affect productivity because it gives the work a place of belonging, it shows the worker that he/she is been appreciated for all the efforts you’ve been putting in and again in the conditions of service it is all stated out there the duration before you move to the next grade level, so it will definitely affect productivity positively, because you know your good works are been recognized by whatever organization you’re working with so it’s a kind of powerful motivation that makes you want to put in your very best too because you know in a short while you’ll be moving ahead again, so you need to put in your best because I think we’ve this appraisal and exams too so, if you don’t really put in your best, your boss won’t score you well, so you won’t be having that promotion, so, this is a kind of motivation to make employees work harder and better, so promotion is a very good motivational technique for making productivity effective.

              <p>
                    Yes, of course, because I am not going to be bragging over it but I know I have been putting in my very best working for the government and if I am been recognized and been promoted as at when due, it will motivate me to put in my extra best like I told you I try to make my working environment conducive for me and I think I will put in more efforts and bring up more methods of making my job easier and better for me, it will make me closer to the office at least they are appreciating what I am doing so I should also in return give them my very best which they expect from me, so, it will motivate me so much.

              <p>
                    In an organization or any work place that a worker has put in several years and have really worked and he/she has not been promotion even if he/she is due or overdue for promotion, it affects the worker psychologically, the person’s will not have a good mindset towards the job because once your mindset is not really focused on the job, this mindset of a thing is very important, the person has to be psychologically fit, If they are due or overdue for promotion and have not been promoted is like they are not been recognized in the organization and all their efforts are not appreciated, they will be demoralized and they don’t have the interest to continue working at that level, so their work rate will reduce and they might not even be available in the office in most cases because they are not appreciated. Promotion is a very important aspect of productivity and it needs to be taken seriously because it affects the mindset of the employee. If you expect good productivity from them, you give them what they need, its their benefit written in the staff conditions of service stating when I should be promoted, so if the organization meet up with this and other benefits it will motivate the worker to put in his very best, but if these things are not put in place then, you can’t expect the best from them.

                        Moving forward sir, we know that sometimes in the public sector, political instability tends to affect the organization, even the change in management of an organization and such cases you know that promotion is been delayed for a long time and it doesn’t come as at when due, now we know it is not the fault of the organization, will it have an impact on your motivation, knowing that things like this can happen?

                  <p>
                        You know, not all workers will understand and again the organization I been owned by the government and if the government is not doing what they are supposed to do, is no longer the organization’s fault and it will have a negative effect in the motivation of employees, because as we earlier said, the mindset will not be there because you’re not been appreciated or recognized, its like modern day slavery, your working and you’re not getting your benefits, it will also kill the employees motivation towards productivity. We are all working in the public sector and we see all these things, it happens to me as well so the way I feel and the way most of my other colleagues feel, I think that is the way other government workers in the public feel too.

                                NHIS is not different from any other government organization, is not as if they are more favoured, we still have our own challenges too. We try to beat and meet up our challenges as well, its not different from any other government organization. I can’t tell you we’re 100% like I told you concerning my work environment, its not really conducive but I try to make it conducive for me because of the kind of job I do, you know we meet and attend to people, we give advice as well so we need to build up ourselves too, so NHIS is not different from any other government organization but we are not doing too bad.

                                        I like the job, but I am not really satisfied to my fullest, it’s a government job and we all know how the job is, you can’t get 100% but you just need to use what you have to get what you need. So I am not really satisfied, because the things that are supposed to be in place are not really there, like the equipment and facilities, good working environment, quiet offices, etc where you can be focused and think properly, we don’t really have all that, its just a few private offices that have those qualities, most of the general offices don’t have those things, you know it affects the job too but I can’t say am fully satisfied but there can be some amendments, some changes that can encourage the staff to put in more of their efforts towards good productivity.

                                                    Of course, it will affect my motivation seriously because if the organization am working with meet up with the standard of a good working environment, you know it will motivate me, and not just the good environment, the benefits too, there are incentives that motivate people to put in their very best, if they meet up all these things, a good working environment, good incentives like fringe benefits and the likes, why won’t people put in their best, except the person is a wicked person that is not ready to work, but these are things that are meant to be that is why they are there, because they know it’s a good way of motivating the worker towards production, it makes you spurred to do the work because you’re being recognized and appreciated by the organization, so if things like the promotion that are motivators are put in place, my job satisfaction will affect my motivation level. So if the job satisfaction is good, it will positively affect the motivation level of every employee.

We know that more satisfaction will lead to more motivation and more motivation will lead to more performance and more performance will lead to more productivity, can you suggest ways you can be more satisfied with your job, to help you get more satisfied in order for you to be more motivated and productive.

                                                                Going back a bit, let’s start with the working environment, like I said earlier, it should be very conducive if you want the employee to think properly and work effectively, a good working environment should possess certain qualities for instance, quietness, space, neat, and should have a good and conducive temperature, if not cool, it should be normal because a hot working environment is not advisable for anyone to work in, we talked about the facilities, chairs, tables, ventilating system, fan, etc. it also aids a good productivity and motivation. We also talked about incentives, fringe benefits, allowances, these things are meant to be because they know it helps the employees, it also encourages and motivates him to put in his best, if you pay these people their benefits, allowances as at when due it will encourage them to put in their best, it is same with promotions too, like we said, you promote these people as at when due and it gives them a sense of belonging it also encourages them to put in their best and motivates them in putting in their best towards productivity. These are things any employer should be looking at to put in place for optimal performance and effectiveness from its employees. There should be a reasonable workforce assigned to every task so as not to overwork people, and they can perform effectively. There should be division of labour and everybody should have his/her own area of specialization, ergonomics like I learnt in psychology, fitting the right man for the job and right job for the man, so, all these should be considered as well as it will affect productivity positively.

In the public sector, we learnt that a lot of people are been placed in job position because of who they know up there not really because they deserve the position, that kind of a thing, when it happens, how does it affect your motivation, does it built trust in the organization or distrust, if this happens does it in any way affect how you’re motivated?

It will affect you psychologically, it makes you feel inferior and it happens in the public sector organizations, you know there is favouritism and it makes people give others positions where they will be comfortable and not effective or productive, it is a wrong thing, how can you attain good productivity with such antics. This is where you apply fitting the right man for the job and right job for the man, you don’t take an accountant to do a doctor’s job, you’ll kill many people and that’s how you’ll kill productivity as well, but when you see improper placement, it affects the motivation of other employees, they will not be thinking of the job anymore, they will be thinking of how they are been humiliated and not been treated fairly.

It kills his morale and his mindset towards the job will drop, it is a positive and negative thing and if you want the positive you have to put these things in place, but when they are not in place, you don’t expect much from these people, is like more of a policy, a government worker should be able to achieve some certain things and these are the things that will help you do the job and give you a good mindset about the job, to calm your head towards the job, so that you’ll deliver and do a good job for us, that is why we are giving you all these incentives, the rewards are things that could come along the way, so if you want to have a good productivity these are things you’ll have to do, so this is the positive way it affects your productivity.

Moving forward, you’ve been able to differentiate between rewards and benefits and even went further to mention some types of rewards and benefits, from the types you’ve listed, what type of rewards and benefits do you think can motivate you more from what you’ve listed, it could still be the one from what you’ve not listed if any, what kind of reward are you expecting from your organization to motivate you more?

I fall into that class because I am not someone that is over expectant, as long as you’re paying me for my services, I am okay. In Nigeria some organizations owe their staff for a long period of time 6months and I don’t want to find myself in that kind of situation, I am very happy and appreciate what you do, is not something that will make me not put in my very best, I really appreciate that this is what we sign up for I will do what I am supposed to do.

Lastly, can you make a recommendation generally on the issue of staff motivation, if you’re placed in a position where you can change things being in this position now, you know what you want, you mentioned ways that you can be satisfied, so can you make a recommendation generally on the issues affecting staff motivation and what the organization can put in place or the government should put in place or if you’re put in a place to change things, what things will you change?

Like we talked about the working environment, if I am in the position to run an organization, firstly, the working environment where my employees will stay to work should be conducive and comfortable for them so they should work on the working environment first then the facilities and equipment should be in order, the right equipment should be gotten for the job and keep them working, then we also look at the benefits of the workers, it is something that motivates them so it should not be ignored, it makes the worker put in even more than what he/she is supposed to put in and it makes the worker have a sense of belonging, so those benefits that are supposed to be paid or given to any employee should not be delayed, then the salaries too should be paid on time. Then staff should be promoted as at when due and even if there is a delay it should not be a very long delay and try to make your workers understand the situation of things, you bring them close to you like your friends, a cordial relationship between the boss and the workers that alone makes them have a sense of belonging, so, when you understand what the workers need, and you give it to them, you’ll have the best from them, so all these things, a good working environment, good working facilities and equipment, benefits, salaries should be put in place. So, if I was to be running an organization, these are things I will consider because these are good motivating factors towards productivity, so these are things that are supposed to be put in place.
