              <p>
                    Okay good morning, Hope Babalola, now in the are of how work environment affect productivity, for instance, in our work place, we stay at least 8 hours daily and if that environment is not conducive enough for staff working in that environment, it will definitely affect the productivity of the organization. An office environment is supposed to be spacious, there should be good air ventilation system, light. If all of these are not in place, then it will affect the productivity of the staff in the organization.
                </p>

            </div>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                    Can you relate how the conduciveness of the office building can spur employee productivity?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">
              <p class="h6 participant badge badge-warning">Participant 5:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                    An office environment is supposed to be accessible, if an office is located in an area that you’ll struggle to locate in terms of address, it will definitely affect employees coming to work. If the road to the office is bad, the stress of passing through it will make you tired upon getting to the office and even you won’t be able to give your best. An office is supposed to be spacious for ease of access, but if an office is jampacked it will also affect productivity. Talking about light I mean natural sunlight that will allow blood to flow freely in the body, if that is not there the body gets tired and a tired staff cannot perform optimally.

              <p>
                    Thank you very much sir, now relating to you personally, will your own work environment have any impact on how productive you are?

              <p>
                    I will say yes, one of the reason is that my office is spacious, can move with ease without inconveniences, the ventilation system in my office is very okay because this natural air is needed by the body system. Also, my office is accessible and I don’t go through stress coming to the office as it is located in the heart of the city.

              <p>
                    Yes of course, promotion in any organization gives you a of been appreciated for doing a great job. You can’t be working in an organization for years without been promoted, it will show that you’re not giving your best and you’re not been creative and innovative for the organization to grow. If you’re promoted it will motivate you to be more innovative and creative as the saying goes “to whom much is given, much is expected”. Promotion plays a vital role and it also affects productivity in any organization.

              <p>
                    If promotion doesn’t come as at when due, do you think it will affect productivity?
              </p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                    Definitely, it will affect productivity, if the promotion doesn’t’ come as at when due, to an extent you’ll be reluctant and there will be no motivating factor. If you’re promoted today, definitely you’ll work harder than you’ve been doing before, so that, the next promotion will be assured for you. But if it doesn’t come as at when due, it will weaken your morale and it will also affect productivity, you’ll not be able to give your best because there is nothing motivating to work so as to get the next promotion.

                    Thank you very much, can you explain the impact of lack of promotion on one’s motivational level?

              <p>
                    Yes, like I said earlier, promotion kind of motivate the staff, but where promotion is not there, in some organizations, it causes the staff to look elsewhere, because one is not expected to stagnate in one position for a very long time. If you as a human being is not growing and you feel comfortable there then something is wrong. If promotion is not coming it will make the staff to look elsewhere and it will cause decrease of staff in that work place,  the work force will be reduced because staff will be looking for where they will get promotion and be more uplifted.

                  <p>
                        Okay, to you now, do you think lack of promotion can affect your motivation level?
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">

                  <p>
                        Definitely, it will reduce, because if it lingers so much a question will be raised “what am I doing here” in as much as I have given my best and I have endured so far and yet this thing is not forthcoming, if there is a better offer somewhere, definitely I will move, but if it is not there, my motivation will drop and it will affect my productivity.

                                                    Thank you very much sir, there is this saying with what I have gathered from the interview which says “more satisfaction will lead to more motivation and more motivation will lead to more performance and more performance will lead to more productivity”. Can suggest ways that will make you more satisfied above the 75% with your job

                                                    Thank you. In an office if there is a good relationship, then it will enhance productivity, but when the relationship between the superior officers and the junior officers is not good and there is no team work, it will reduce productivity. So, the senior cadre should relate well with the junior cadre and also, there should good working relationship among staff which will increase productivity. Another suggestion will be training and development, in as much as we know our job, we still need training go attain perfection, so we need training and re-training as to be able to give 100%.

                                                        Yes, if I am trained, I will be more satisfied and also if work place incentives are given to staff I will be more satisfied and it will enhance my productivity. Another thing is recognizing and appreciating what I do, which will spur me to do more and it will make me more satisfied. My best will hardly come out if the office environment is not safe, but if the environment is conducive and safe, then I will be sure of giving my best and I will be satisfied. Lastly, the welfare package, if a better welfare package is in place, it will make me more satisfied and will also boost my morale which will enhance my productivity. If these are in place, it will enhance productivity.

                                                            Well reward sometimes comes in monetary aspect, other times as gift and also as appreciation then I see benefit as what I will gain at the end of my service, for instance, pension package, etc.

                                                      <p>Reward and benefits will definitely have an impact on staff motivation, when a staff is rewarded it tends to spur him/her to achieve the organization’s goals and objectives, but once there is no reward or benefit system it will bring about demotivation. So, therefore, rewards tends to promote motivation and productivity.</p>

Another reward I would like is award of excellence which will spur me greatly to add more creativity and innovativeness to the organization.

                                                                      </p>

It is only when I make a request that I need something and I couldn’t get what I requested, it will definitely affect me but any kind of reward I get will motivate me.

In a way it brings motivation. Some organization that have supervisors, to some extent it might increase productivity, while it might also reduce productivity because some persons do not feel comfortable when they are been monitored.

Pension should be well designed so that we will easily get our gratuity and pension monthly stipend, our environment should be more conducive and friendly so as for us to be able to live healthily. Allowances should be increased and paid as at when due.
