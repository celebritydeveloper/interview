                    Work environment can affect productivity negatively or positively. It will affect negatively if the work environment is not conducive enough, it will make work very difficult, sometimes we have external factors as well, like in Nigeria one major factor is power supply and when there is no power supply we cannot work on our systems, we have gotten to the jet age where we’ve stopped using paper and most jobs are done with computer systems, so lack of lack power makes the office to spend more on fuel and it’s a very expensive way of working, so our major issue is light. Another the environment affects productivity is accessibility, most roads are very bad and to get client to come to the office most times is very difficult, sometimes we have issues with addresses, for clients to come into the place, there are no concrete address you can use which affects productivity because clients might get tired of the description and decides not to come again. Noise pollution is another factor, when you’re working and there is some much noise, either internally or externally, it affects productivity because you lose concentration while working.

                    Like I said earlier, though I was talking about the external factors, but the external factors still affect the internal factors too, our office NHIS where I work the environment is not very good, is been polluted by water most times, the drainage system is very poor, so it even affects your stay in office while working, the light condition is very poor so it affects productivity because the office environment is not even conducive at all. Another reason is space, in the office where we are the space is not enough, and sometimes we have more staff than the acquired space and where to seat to work tends to be a problem even in some days where the generating set is on, so those are some of the factors that affects us.

                    Thank you very much ma, how will promotion employee generally affect productivity?

              <p>
                    Everybody likes to be applauded or praised for the effectiveness of the work you’ve done, so if staff are not been promoted it will affect the job negatively because the staff will not be happy and most at times the state of your mind makes work effective, and if you’re not happy, you can’t work well but if you’re happy you work better. When staff work and they don’t see the result of their work, sometimes its not just monetary, but the fact that you’re recognized that you did well and you can move to a higher level makes staff want to work better, so promotion is key to employees productivity.

                    Definitely, because my mind will be sound to work for that day, and even where my intellect is needed, it will be in place to ditch out whatever is required. So, definitely a good work environment will increase my productivity.

              <p>
                    Yes it will, because if I work for so long and I don’t promoted, it will demoralize me and also promotion comes with incentives which is monetary, and the monetary incentives will make you want to do better because you know that you’re rewarded for the work that you’ve done, personally I have been in the system for over 15 years, if I have not been promoted once or twice or as at when due it would make my productivity very poor and it might even affect my coming to work.

              <p>
                    Okay ma, now going forward, we know that in the public sector here where we work, sometimes the lack of promotion is not caused by the organization, it can come as a result of political instability for instance, change of government or management, which might slow down the promotion, in that case it is not the fault of the organization, in that aspect will still affect your performance knowing that it is not caused by management of the organization, will it have any effect on your work performance?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                Sincerely, as a human being it will still affect performance because even there is a new government or management, things can still be put in place, the government that is handing over can do that on time and make sure that promotion comes at the right time. Some organizations, regardless of change of government or management, promotion still comes if they take it as a point of necessity that all staff should be promoted at a certain time, no matter the change, promotion will still come and it will still affect productivity.

              <p>
                    Thank you very much ma, can you explain the impact lack of promotion will have on your own motivational level?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">

              <p>
                    It will surely have a negative impact, because the first thing is that it would demoralize me as a person and like we say, people live by planning and if your know that you’re supposed to be promoted in every 4years and get increment in salary, you’ll work by it, but when I not promoted, personally I will not be motivated to work harder, it shows that the organization doesn’t have staff in mind.

                        We have been able to interview other participants before you and the level of interaction we’ve had we realize that some of them are intrinsically motivated that is natural or motivation that comes from within and for the fact that they have a job, a home and salaries are coming as at when due, it doesn’t affect their motivation level, so in your case can you say you’re intrinsically motivated or extrinsically motivated which has to do with what you’ve mentioned like promotion, salaries, etc so, if promotion doesn’t come does that mean you will not be motivated to do your work?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                        Like I said earlier, my work will still be done but I will be demoralized, and when I am demoralized consciously or unconsciously it will affect my performance, like I said it will affect my state of mind and when the state of mind is been affected, it affects productivity too, so if I on my own part is doing my work properly, the organization too should put the staff in mind and do their own part so that productivity will have a balance.

                            Thank you very much ma, moving to the next phase of the interview, to what extent do you think NHIS workers are satisfied with their job, based on your interactions with your colleagues?

                            So far, NHIS staff are happy that they are employed, but it still need government to make the work environment better and more conducive for work to be effective, so I can say they are just happy with the job but they are not satisfied.

                                                        It varies. The most important thing is that, even if you’re not 100% motivated your work has to be done, if you work based on your motivation you’ll be very ineffective and your work will not be done, and if the government is not doing their part and we’re not doing our part either the organization might not exist anymore so you can’t work based on your motivation level so, you have to be intrinsically motivated a little to make you work and working at 30% is very poor and it will not make anything happen in the organization so one works above their satisfaction.

We know that more satisfaction will lead to more motivation and more motivation will lead to more performance and more performance will lead to more productivity which every organization would want to attain, if possible organizations would want to attain a 100% productivity, and now rating your satisfaction level at 30%. Can you suggest ways you can more satisfied?

Benefit sometimes comes in monetary form and when you know that your future is somehow guaranteed and that there is something kept for you even after leaving the service, it will motivate you knowing that even when you leave the organization I have something to go back to, it will make you not to misbehave so that you’ll not loss your job and make you want to work and retire at the right time, so that whatever is been kept aside for you, be it pension or gratuity you’ll get so it will motivated you to work harder and well so that what is laid for them in the future will get to them.

Benefit sometimes comes in monetary form and when you know that your future is somehow guaranteed and that there is something kept for you even after leaving the service, it will motivate you knowing that even when you leave the organization I have something to go back to, it will make you not to misbehave so that you’ll not loss your job and make you want to work and retire at the right time, so that whatever is been kept aside for you, be it pension or gratuity you’ll get so it will motivated you to work harder and well so that what is laid for them in the future will get to them.

In general, when you’re rewarded for the good you do, it will motivate you to do better. When I was much younger in the primary school, our teacher made class monitors weekly based on your performance and on a termly basis and it was a form of reward so students started striving harder so that they can be class captain, it is the same thing with the work environment where we are working, if you’re been rewarded for what you’ve done it will make you work better. Apart from that incentives and allowances are been given which will help the staff be more motivated to work knowing that apart from salary there is something you can take home for the good work you’ve done. Everybody wants to be recognized for their efforts, and if incentives can be added, allowances can be added and you can be recognized, all these would help in motivating staff.

There should be good space, laptops, etc for a better performance.
