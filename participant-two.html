              <p>
                    12 years work experience. So, our first question is how does environment affect productivity for this period of time that we've been working in the public sector in the NHIS. 
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">
              <p class="h6 participant badge badge-warning">Participant 2:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                    Work environment is very vital factor as regards productivity. Because it is very clear that we need an environment that is conducive to be able to impact positively on productivity. If the temperature an office area is hot and the working environment is rowdy and crowded it will affect productivity negatively. And also, safety measures put in place in the environment you work is also a key factor in productivity, if you are not sure of your safety in the place you work, you know it tends to reduce productivity. Another factor is the ventilation of the office, if the office is not well ventilated meaning you’re not comfortable in your place of work and it tends to affect productivity a lot too. Also, the office furniture, the kind of chair and table you have in your office, if it doesn’t make your comfortable it affects productivity negatively too, office gadgets like computer, wifi system, etc is also another factor, if they are working well it tends to increase productivity, but if the reverse is the case, productivity is affected negatively.
                    Constant power supply is also a key factor, if there is constant power supply productivity increases, but if there is no power supply, everything is on a stand still.

              <p>
                    Thank you. So, here in NHIS how can you now say that NHIS environment is affecting your performance and productivity with what you’ve just mentioned that affects work environment?

              <p>
                    For me, NHIS office environment has a positive effect on productivity because most of the things I mentioned here has been taken care of, power is constant, the location of the office is in a serene area that is not rowdy or noisy, for me as per the environment, we have a very positive stand as per the environment affecting productivity.

              <p>
                    Thank you, will your workplace environment have any impact on your productivity? I know you have mentioned a few on how environment can affect productivity looking at your environment right now, what will you say, will it affect your productivity? Will it affect your performance?
              </p>

              <p>
                    Yes, the environment will affect productivity, like I said before, if it the environment is not a positive one it will affect productivity negatively. But in this our environment, it will affect productivity positively.

              <p>
                    So, on the other part, how will promotion of employees affect productivity? 
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">

              <p>
                    Promotion of employee is a very vital and key area in any service, when things are not progressing, employees will not be happy and it will affect productivity because most of the employees will not be on ground, they will be looking for employment elsewhere, also, if an employee is not promoted, his morale drops and he becomes unhappy with same salary over the years.

              <p>
                    Will promotion have any impact on your own work performance because generally we've been looking at employees. So personally, on your own will promotion have any effect on your own performance in this organization?

              <p>
                    Yes, if I am promoted as at when due, you’ll find out that I will be happy, I will bring up new ideas in the work place, I will tend to push things forward because when you’re happy in a place, you tend to make it work and give your all.

              <p>
                    Thank you. Can you explain further, the impact of lack of promotion on your own motivation level?

              <p>
                    If I am not promoted, I am static and it makes me unhappy with the organization because all my efforts comes to nothing and therefore it will make me to look for job elsewhere.

              <p>
                    In other words, are you saying that lack of promotion will determine the level at which you’re motivated?

              <p>
                    Yes. To me promotion is very vital. When you’re being promoted as at when due, it gives you a sense of belonging.
