                    6 years in the public sector. The first question is how does work environment affect productivity? 
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">
              <p class="h6 participant badge badge-warning">Participant 3:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                    The work environment is very critical to staff productivity. For instance, if the environment is very dirty, it will make some staff to stay away thereby abandoning their duties. Another factor is the temperature, if the temperature of an office environment is very hot, it will make the employees to be uncomfortable and they will not be able to perform optimally. The quality of supervision in the working environment is also critical, if the employer is always shouting at the supervisors and if managers are always shouting on the employees, it also affects their morale and it will make them not work optimally. Also, if you have colleagues with negative mindset, they will affect you negatively “I call it the bad wagon influence” but if you’ve positive minded colleagues who are always looking at achieving the goal of the organization, it will affect you positively as well.
                </p>
                <p>Environment as a factor is very wide, you have the socio-cultural factors, political/regulatory factors, under political factors, we have issues like political instability coup d’etat all these are factors that affects productivity. On the regulatory side, we have government laws that impacts on productivity, like increment of personnel income tax, but if reduced, if will encourage employees. We also have social factors like believe system, customs and traditions. So the environmental factors are broad, some are direct and others indirect.</p>

              <p>
                    Please can you mention some of the indirect factors for record purpose?

              <p>
                    There is always this multiplier effect, for instance, when you reduce the salary of an employee, he/she has dependants, friends and family that also depends on him one way or the other. It will affect them.

                    Thank you sir, moving on to the next question, on your own personal perspective, will your work environment have an effect on your productivity?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">

              <p>
                    To a very great extent it affects. Assuming I am doing computation and am using just a calculator I am bound to make mistakes. But if am using Ms Excel application that is used for calculation, it will give me better outcome thereby reducing the amount of mistakes. For instance, the minimum wage is not reviewed it means the ability of employees to purchase goods and services is reduced. If the minimum wage is increased, a worker like me will have a higher purchasing power which will affect my productivity level as well. If you look at a noisy working environment, it will make you not to concentrate properly and thereby having a negative effect on the job. Considering power supply, if you don’t have constant power supply it will have negative effect on workers productivity. If there is no power supply it means you can’t use your computer system, office will be hot and there will be lack of water also.

                    Thank you very much sir. How will promotion of employees affect productivity?

              <p>
                    Promotion affects the productivity level of employees positively, you don’t expect to promote a worker and expect a recalcitrant attitude, promotion makes employees put in their best in the organization and makes them to work extra miles, and employ their own little resources to make sure they deliver any task given to them to accomplish. Promotion will help and employee to look at the company goals and missions and plan how ways he/she can help the organization achieve such goals. Promotion is not meant to discourage a worker, it is meant to stimulate the worker to put in his or her best. It is a key factor in every organization and cannot be overemphasized. It makes you realize that all the efforts he/she has been putting in, the organization recognizes it and its like saying thank you for job well done.

                    Thank you very much sir, will promotion have any effect on your work performance?

              <p>
                    As a person, I motivate myself and I set my own targets. The promotion from the employer is an instrument that will stimulate an employee to put in his/her best. So, on a positive note promotion influences my behaviour as long as I know I will get my promotion as at when due, it will stimulate me positively to do everything within my capacity to make sure the goals, mission and vision of the organization are achieved. Because in achieving those goals and missions, I am setting pathway for another promotion, which is very important personally for me, I am greatly motivated by promotion.

              <p>
                    So, in other words promotion will have a great impact on how you perform, those is mean if promotion doesn’t come as at when due, your performance will reduce?

                    It will not. Because from the onset, I set my goals and when the organization sees my hard work they will do the needful so it doesn’t affect my productivity in any way.

                    Yes sir, I agree but sometimes in the public sector there some factors as earlier mention by you can delay/hinder promotion, not because you’re not due or not hardworking but because of those factors so, will it demotivate you in anyway?

              <p>
                    Well for me I love my job and because I love my job, I will always want to do my best notwithstanding the economic, political and social realities, I will always want to do my best. If I am promoted or not, I will put in my best and be satisfied. If I am dissatisfied, I have to resign, but if am not resigning, I have to put in my best and I believe one day things will be done properly. I won’t be discouraged or become recalcitrant or one that is not always in the office when I am supposed to be performing my duty, It will not make stop what I know how to do best.

            <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                    Can you explain the impact of lack of promotion on your motivation level? If for instance, something happens and for a long period there will be no promotion due to one of the factors mentioned earlier.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">

              <p>
                    Although, when promotion doesn’t come at the right time, it affects you in several ways. It is going to affect my take home pay because its not review due to lack of promotion, there is inflation in the economy and my ability to buy will be affected, that’s on the economic side. In terms of work, It will only be negative if am not promoted and someone else is promoted, but if it affects everyone, I don’t think there are serious negative implication, but if my colleagues are been promoted and I am not, I have to ask myself if I am not putting in my best, if I am not helping the organization achieve her goal, but if that is reason then I have call myself to order and put my best, but if the factors are not from me, I just still have to put in my best, nobody knows I can earn a double or triple promotion.

                        Thank you sir. Due to corruption in the society, unqualified people tends to moved farther than those more qualified and it happens to be a case in your organization and you’re been side-lined from your promotion and the boss is promoting one set of persons who you’re more qualified than, will your motivation level remain the same or it will be affected?

                  <p>
                        Well, it will certainly affect my motivation if things like corruption, nepotism and favouritism come into play. It is going to affect my motivation and productivity because I will not be expected to do everything while others take the credit, its discouraging and disheartening, everyone needs recognition if you put in your best. When the wrong person is being promoted because of nepotism and corruption it will also affect the organization negatively. I don’t think the organization is doing herself any good, you don’t expect to put something on nothing and expect it to stand. If you promote the wrong set of persons, you’ll get wrong result, because those working will be demoralized because they are humans, it will demotivate them to some extent.

                                    It will affect my motivation level, so I expect my employer to always do the needful, promotion should be based on productivity and hard work not on nepotism or connection or affiliation and association. The goals of the organization should be looked at first, because when the wrong persons are promoted the right ones get demotivated.

So, to a very great extent, we are satisfied.

So as workers we put in our best. We are also sent out for trainings and it comes with duty tour allowance as well. So these factors, influences us positively.

For employees that are not self-motivated, rewards, benefits, bonuses, profit sharing and commissions are very important. These are factors that motivates employees, if you give them financial rewards they will be possibly motivated. Even when they are working, there are cases where employees are given productivity bonuses, end of year bonuses, bonuses for accident free environment, or achieving a particular milestone without accident or incident that will affect productivity negatively. So, it stimulates employees to work effectively and efficiently.

You’re not supposed to be expecting monetary rewards always to motivate you for doing a job you’re paid to do, that is why workshops, seminars and trainings are important. It is not all about monetary benefits.

If I am been driven by money alone as a factor that will motivate me, it means if money doesn’t come it will affect my productivity negatively, so its not just money always though it also motivates.

                                                                                      <p class="h6 participant badge badge-warning">Participant 3:</p>

                                                                                      <p>
                                                                                            Having the right kind of leadership or supervision, if your supervisor is someone that encourages and corrects you when you’re wrong, it’s a good form of motivation. As earlier stated, the kind of work place you find yourself is very important, if your work place is not clean and hygienic, it discourages staff, so the right kind of sanitary condition will go along way. The right kind of personnel is also very important to spur you to achieve more. Government policies should be employee friendly and not one that will discourage employees. Employers should also ensure to have a competitive advantage over their counterparts. The right kind of facilities should also be put in place to achieve the best from employees.
