              <p>
                Work environment has a long way in affecting productivity, in
                the sense that, for one to productive, there are environmental
                factors that come to play. The security of the work environment
                which gives the workers a sense of safety, a place that will
                give staff the comfort and serenity of mindset to concentrate
                and do their job. The environment needs to be clean and
                hygienic, if the toilet systems are bad or convenience is not
                adequate for staff, it affects productivity. In an industrial
                environment where gas flaring and other industrial activities
                are being carried out, there should be adequate care of the
                staff who inhales such chemicals as it will bring about health
                challenges if not properly managed and will tend to affect
                productivity. For a staff to be productive, the environment
                needs to be conducive, so to this extent, I believe environment
                affects productivity in work places.

              <p>
                Yes, rating my place of work, I will say 90% and that has given
                us this relaxation, this sense of safety, calmness and
                confidence in doing our job. Everything that is expected is
                almost 90% in place, we have no stress or element to discourage
                us, such that it will affect our productivity and it has also
                reflected in our output as an organization. Our performance has
                drastically improved since the environment became this hygienic,
                we don’t have security treats within our environment so every
                staff hands are on deck because no one has any reason for
                excuses, because the organization has created a conducive
                environment for us to work.

                Thank you very much sir. How will promotion of employees affect
                productivity?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">

            <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                The promotion of employees goes a long way to affect
                productivity. As a firm believer of Christ, even God has
                ordained us for advancement in life. God expects people not to
                be stagnated but to make progress. One factor that motivates
                workers is promotion, productivity is the bedrock for promotion,
                if anyone desires to be promoted the persons’ focus should be
                productivity. In our organization, promotion comes as at when
                due because the organization is satisfied with our productivity.
                There is no stagnation here because everyone has been putting in
                their best. So, promotion has diverse effect on work
                performance. Anyone who is productive but is not promoted will
                feel not appreciated and it has a way of affecting the
                performance of such staff. Promotion is key to work performance.
                In life, appreciation is like asking for more.

              <p>
                Yes, I wouldn’t want a situation where I won’t get promoted as
                at when due, so I put in my best to make sure I am promoted.
                Personally, whenever I see my promotion letter, I feel
                appreciated and is motivated to do more for the organization. I
                believe promotion has enhanced my performance. Promotion gives
                you a sense of belonging, it makes you feel valued by the
                organization.

                Lack of promotion makes me feel am actually not good enough for
                the job am doing, it makes me feel I have been performing below
                expectation. Though it is two sided. If you’re performing well
                and not promoted, it makes you feel rejected and no sense of
                belonging, and such feeling gives depression and it affects
                productivity.

                Yes, it will reduce my level of motivation, knowing fully well
                that I am doing all that is expected and am not promoted, it
                will make me scale down my performance and my motivation will be
                affected negatively.

                To what extent are NHIS workers satisfied with their jobs based

                I think 90% of NHIS staff workers are satisfied with their job.
                Because our renumeration is not poor, its on the average and
                with good management you can sort out your needs comfortably.
                Aside that we have allowances, which makes you feel valued by
                the organization. Though humans are always on the look out for
                more, but on a very sincere note, NHIS staff are satisfied, most
                especially when compared to other organization’s staff.

                I am very satisfied. The work environment is very conducive, the
                renumeration is enticing, free health care for my family,
                another factor is the training and re-training of staff by
                management which builds our capacity, we are trained and also
                given training allowances. More so, we are given privileges of

                study leave that comes with pay, where a staff can further
                his/her education while on the job. We get good incentives
                during festive seasons and we have severally allowances like
                education, wardrobe, etc and it is paid on the first month of
                the year.

                                Yes of course, simply put 90% satisfaction gives you 90% motivation,
                                10% satisfaction gives you 10% motivation, and 10% of motivation
                                gives you 10% productivity and 90% motivation gives you 90%
                                productivity. The level of satisfaction affects motivation to a very
                                great extent both positively and negatively. No satisfaction no
                                motivation, adequate satisfaction gives you adequate motivation. As
                                a person, I am satisfied and it spurs me, I tend to look for a new
                                way to improve myself and my organization. I have annual leave every
                                year and it motivates me. I am satisfied and it is the reason why I
                                am motivated, and the motivation is the reason why I am highly
                                productive.

                                    There is always room for improvement, more satisfaction and
                                    advancement. One thing I can we can do is a constant review of our
                                    motivating strategies, our incentive packages. What is the present
                                    situation of the economy, present price of goods in the market, and
                                    how can the renumeration and allowances be able to get this things
                                    comfortably for this workers. Another factor is reviewing the
                                    benefits of the these training, how it has impacted on the staff or
                                    the training is yielding result. If the training is impactful, the
                                    staff will be more motivated. We must make sure that the working
                                    environment is not deteriorating. The health packages also needs
                                    review, what are the standards of this hospitals we are assigning
                                    our staff to, are they global standards, if not they should not be
                                    given as an health care provider to our staff. If the standards of
                                    the hospital is deteriorating staff should be taken away from there,
                                    the agreement should be yearly and there should be review of the
                                    hospital facilities and environment. Allowances should be topped up
                                    yearly due to increase in cost of products and services including
                                    educational fees. More so, there should be a constant environmental
                                    security check, security gives workers sense of safety and it should
                                    be sustained. Constant security tips, training of security
                                    personnel. Constant increase in workers wages and salary. Another
                                    suggestion is that, promotion that comes as at when due should be
                                    sustained and the incentive that accompanies the promotion should be
                                    reviewed. Allowances should also come as at when due.

                                        Thank you sir. Will reward and benefit have an impact on staff
                                        motivation?
                                  </p>
                                </div>

                                        Reward and benefits are the two cardinal factors that makes for
                                        motivation or demotivation. Whatever you do, must always come with a
                                        benefit, if there is no benefit, then there is no reason for that
                                        job to be done. But if I get benefits, it motivates me, in this
                                        organization I have health benefit, education benefit, capacity
                                        building benefits that comes via training and re-training. Reward
                                        system is key, its not same as promotion, stipulated benefits staff
                                        have been enjoying, its deliberate occasional initiative that
                                        management brings in to spur or to motivate staff. Its when you’re
                                        recognized among other staff, like an award/accolade, which gives
                                        you this sense of dignity, appreciated and valued. It gives positive
                                        impact on staff, it enhances your input, it makes you more
                                        satisfied. So therefore, reward and benefit are integral part of
                                        organizational success, they are the bedrock for staff motivation
                                        and satisfaction. No one wants to do what is not profiting. Any
                                        organization that wants to be successful should ensure that staff
                                        are been rewarded and staff have benefit for their input.

                                            Thank you sir. What type of reward do you think can motivate you
                                            more?
                                      </p>
                                    </div>

                                            A reward coming from a sincere heart is enough for me, the size,
                                            volume, quantity or quality is a secondary issue, primarily that
                                            sense of acknowledgement is the main deal. Though as humans every
                                            reward comes with something, but any reward the management deems fit
                                            for me is okay for me, a car, framed picture, wall clock, etc will
                                            be okay by me but it should come from a sincere heart.

                                                Thank you very much sir, the last question, will the level of reward
                                                and benefit you receive affect your level of motivation and also
                                                give is recommendations as well?
                                          </p>
                                        </div>
                                        <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">

                                          <p>
                                                As I said, I will be okay with a sincere heart but actions speaks
                                                louder than voice. If a car and phone is offered to me I will go for
                                                the car because of value and it will serve as a legacy and each day
                                                I see it, I will be motivated to work more. Benefit and rewards goes
                                                a long way to motivate me. The level of reward cannot be
                                                overemphasized. Certain reward looks like a mockery and it
                                                demotivates, but whatever is coming from the heart will be something
                                                good. To this extent reward and benefit system, they are the bedrock
                                                of organizational success.
