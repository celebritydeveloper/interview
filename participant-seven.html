                    7 years, thank you very much sir. Going straight to the first question, How does work environment affect productivity generally?

              <p>
                    Work environment has an effect on productivity, for the purpose of this work I would like us to look at the factors, we have some internal factors and external factors that affects productivity in a work place. For instance, the external factors has to do with customs, other laws of the community within which the business operates, that in a way affects decisions made by the organization. For the internal factors, it has to do with surroundings, and the way the work itself operates within the organization. In other words it has effects and sometimes it could be adverse, for instance, some of the laws, customs and laws of the community within which the business operate might tend to pose some challenges to the organization and in the process it might create some challenges for the organization.

              <p>
                    On the part of the internal factors, we have issues like lack of facilities and equipment to work with and also small office space that makes for difficulty in operation can as well hamper the productivity of an organization.

                    My work environment will definitely have an impact on how productive I am, all these things I have mentioned so far have a direct bearing on how you carry out your day to day functions. Most of these things are need to enhance your performance and if they are not available, it will affect your level of performance which in turn will affect productivity. For instance, the convenience in the office is not conducive for use sometimes and it causes you inconvenience and discomfort which lead to unproductiveness as the staff will not be in the right frame of mind to enhance production.

                    I know that no employee would want to engage continuously in a dead end job, everyone is looking out for acceleration, if an employee is recognized for promotion it further boost the performance of the staff. It gives the person a sense of belonging that he/she is been remembered and rewarded accordingly, so that sense of feeling that he/she is actually doing the job well will bring about more motivation to perform better. So, I think generally, promotion affects productivity. Sometimes, when promotion opportunities are not given to employees, people tend to leave the organization and seek for better greener pastures because no one wants to remain stagnate, they want to move forward. So, I think promotion has a positive effect on productivity.

              <p>
                    Thank you very much sir, so promotion will impact productivity either negatively or positively. Does it matter if it comes as at when due or after a long while, do you think it will impact productivity if it comes on time or is delayed?

              <p>
                    Sure, if it doesn’t come when it is expected, there will be a diverse effect. Promotion is expected to come as at when due because employees are already aware of the timing. So, when it doesn’t come as expected, it will demoralize the employees thereby impacting negatively on their performance.

              <p>
                    Yes, it will definitely have a great impact on my performance, it will send a signal to me that I have been promoted because of the good work or hard work I am doing in the organization, so, it will definitely enhance my performance and make me to work harder for further promotions having it in mind that the more I work the more productive I become and the more I get promotion opportunities. So, of course it will definitely enhance my performance.

                        When workers are not promoted, there will be outcry, the place will be jilted up, the workers will feel their work is not appreciated, their efforts not been recognized. So, from the beginning, you’ve already created an impression that his/her services are not useful in the organization so, it will definitely affect the person’s performance, because the person’s work, effort and all he/she is doing in the organization is not been appreciated so it will not further motivate the person to do more, because even if he does that, it will not amount to promotion benefits so the person’s morale will be affected.

                            It will, because we all political animals and if am not promoted, it will definitely affect my work performance because it is part of the agreement that I am expected to be promoted as at when due and when its not forth coming as I mentioned earlier it will seem to me that my services are no longer required or not been recognized or am not doing what is expected of me to get a promotion, it will affect my morale and demoralize me which is going to bring about unproductivity and low performance.

                                Okay sir, in your first answer you mentioned economic, political and laws of the community how it can affect productivity, do you also think it can hinder or delay promotion when necessary, as you’re aware, some of the political factors might not necessarily be the fault of the organization, especially political instability when there is a change of government and when this happens its actually the fault of the organization, when it delays promotion which you know is the fault of the organization, will it still affect your motivation level?
                          </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">

                          <p>
                                Having considered these factors before now and having known them, I see them as external and they are not under the control by the organization so I wouldn’t see that as a deliberate attempt by the organization to delay my promotion, though as humans it will tend to have a negative impact but not so serious since its not coming from the organization but as an external factor and its beyond our control so it will be understandable, but our anger will still be directed to the government and it will in turn affect our performance one way or another.

                                    It is obvious that most employees don’t seem to be comfortable and not happy with their jobs because of certain policies that are not pleasant to us as employees and promises that are not kept and a lot of things are not worked out as planned, so, a lot of staff tends to loss faith in the organization, so with the conversations I have had with them, a lot of people are not happy.

When information is communicated freely, it will further enhance the trust between management and employees.

Benefits on the other hand, has to do with things that are accrued to the employees, like pay benefits and when this things are not forthcoming as stipulated in the conditions of service, it will affect the employee as motivation. When these things are given as at when due it will bring more productivity.

And if that’s is what you’ll gain, its as good as you not gaining anything, it might not earn you a good land, not to talk of building a house, so if you’re not given the due recognition and benefits now that you’re in service, which means they are preparing you for poverty. If they want you to succeed, the plan should be now that you’re in service.

                                                                                                            A robust pay at the end of my service, as an appreciation for a job well done, if that could be done by employers I think it will make whoever that is in service to put in his/her best. Even if they don’t get anything in service, they believe that someday something is coming so they will not want to be sacked or have issues, but rather they’ll want to be committed and work to gain that thing at last.

The life of the employees must be insured as well. Salary should be paid as at when due and it should be reviewed upward from time to time and all other renumeration should be paid accordingly when it is due, also, employees should be granted housing loans.
