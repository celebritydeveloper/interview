                    Productivity is a tenacity in any organization, both private and public sector. Once there is no productivity, you’ll tend to see many flaws in the organizational structure. Work environment is very essential in every organized sector be it private or public. For instance, looking at the organizational structure of an organization, if it is not well organized, they tend to be flaws in the hierarchy and the system which affects productivity in that organization. Firstly, looking at how an office is organized, basically, in the public sector we have an inflow of populated employees which as a result of that brings about inefficiency as regards to the private sector, when we talk about inefficiency in the public sector, there are so many employed staff without a job function and it causes overstaffing and inefficiency. Another issue is lack of facilities like laptops or desktop to work with due to the overstaffed nature of the organization, thereby causing unproductivity. Power supply is not also available due to lack of planning in the public sector on the part of the senior managers due to lack of competitiveness in the public sector, lack of desks and chairs to work with. In some organized public sectors you’ll see things like portable drinking water and tea/coffee  break that makes working comfortable. There are issues with environmental flaws as well where conveniences are not working properly, the environment is not serene and the temperature is very hot due to lack of air conditioners in the office environment which tends to affect productivity. The style of leadership is also a necessity in productivity, some are friendly and accommodating while some are like dictators and tyrants, as an employee of an organization, once your leader is friendly it also boost productivity in the work place but if that is not there you see things like inefficiency, decline, low team spiritedness, etc, so leadership style also affects productivity.

                    Thank you very much sir, will your own work environment have an impact on your productivity?

              <p>
                    It can have an impact, as earlier discussed if such things are not put in place, definitely it will affect me as an individual in my work place as individual we have emotions and it comes to play even at work too. If my boss is always tyrannical and there is no sense of friendship or encourage, as a human there will be a decline in my productivity and when the environment is not serene enough, it will affect my productivity as well because as an individual I cannot work in an environment that is not hygienic and comfortable or friendly because it will affect my productivity as I won’t be able to put in my best and cannot work with sincerity of purpose, no team spirit and flaws will be inevitable in my work. So, it greatly affects my productivity.

              <p>
                    Thank you very much sir, you mentioned team spirit, can it be related to trust in the organization and colleagues, do you think trust in anyway can have impact on employee productivity?

              <p>
                    Trust, dedication and commitment are vital factors that builds up team spirit and once it is not there team spirit dies because as individuals we work collectively and if a colleague is not reliable that alone can bring a distrust because there tends to be delegated powers given to superiors and subordinate and once it is not in play, definitely there will be a decline in productivity, so trust is very essential in an organization.

                    Thank you very much sir, moving to the part of the question, how will promotion of employees affect productivity generally?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                    Promotion is very essential in the public sector, once there is no promotion it will demoralize the employee. In a situation where there is no promotion, you’ll see rivalry, for instance, if a superior tends to delegate duties to a subordinate, in is mind he will hesitate and says if I am promoted will you talk to me like that, so you’ll see once there is no promotion there tend to be flaws, inefficiency, decline in productivity, hate speech and so on. Promotion is very essential and it should come as at when due because delay of promotion also affects productivity.

              <p>
                    Thank you sir, personally will promotion have any impact on your work performance, some persons are motivated intrinsically and sometimes needs nothing to spur their performance? 
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">

            <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                    Definitely it will have an impact on my performance, I am not intrinsically motivated so, I put in my best, time, energy and skills to make sure I get result as at when due, and once promotion doesn’t come into play, it kills my morale because you cannot be working in organization where you put team work, dedication and selfless service and at the end there is no feeling of accomplishment.

              <p>
                    Thank you sir, can you explain the impact of lack of promotion on your own motivational level?

              <p>
                    As a result of that, work is not done when due, firstly, the time and energy I put to work has been killed I just resolve within myself that I am only working with reward or benefit so I tend to kill the zeal to work which also affects my productivity. Secondly, I don’t feel motivated because if an organization where you work doesn’t think of your welfare or career it kills your morale and ethics come to play whereby things that you’re not supposed to do, you start doing them that’s is why in most public sectors we see things like kickbacks because you feel like you’re working and your effort is not been appreciated and in the long run you tend to see a lot of unethical values which comes to play and it affects your motivational level.

                        It has to do with the organization because it is part and parcel of the motivational spirit, because the structure is on a wrong track or started wrongly it will affect as well. Training are not forth coming and even if you go for a training, you don’t get the needed incentives that goes with the training. Health and insurance is a vital part of any economy and as an employee here, you’ve to abreast with the operational activities and day to day running of activities so many of us in NHIS we are not aware of the global best practices and it also affects us. That aside, we have issues like lack of team spirit which is as a result of no commitment in the part of management.

                                    Well, every individual differs but for me lack of promotion demoralizes me and because of that, it cannot motivate me. Once you’re in an organization and everything is not put in place to see that your productivity comes to play, that tends to lower the motivation in you.

                                        Thank you sir, we know that policies are implemented for citizens to meet their basic needs. Now for organizations to achieve the policy objective they have to put in a 100% productivity, and for organization to attain a 100% staff needs to be satisfied and perform at 100% level. Will your level of satisfaction affect your level of motivation?

                                        Yes, it will because I feel loved and have a sense of belonging and been in a system that works, because I work with energy, time and sincerity of purpose and I tend to put in my best in all I do and as result of that once this doesn’t come into play, definitely job satisfaction will not be there, because once job satisfaction is not there all these things comes into place, there have to be a system and the system has to work because you cannot be working in environment where there is constant power failure, no system to work with, this is a jet age and in some organized sectors you see an employee to a system, but here you see 3 employees sharing a system, I mean productivity will not come into play as a result of that, work will not be done on time, deliverance, set piece, both quality and quantity of work will not be there because of all these flaws which tends to affect it. So, basically my job satisfaction, my motivation will come when the right environment and facilities are provided for work to be carried out.

                                        Once a job is been given to you, there should consistent training on the job description and when that comes into play there tends to be productivity, so, there should be constant training in the NHIS sector so that we can meet up with global standard because health and insurance is key to the any economy and organization. Consistent training will boost motivation. When the right incentives are given at the right time it will also boost morale for motivation. Also, appreciation and acknowledgement of a job well done will also spur employees to work. In organized public sectors, vehicles are provided for the transportation of its employees and it also boost the morale of staff. The serenity of an environment also boost the morale of an employee, the environment should be cosy, comfortable and should be a place where staff are comfortable to stay and it is easy to over-time when the need arises. Little things like tea/coffee break, water dispenser, constant power supply, kind of furniture you use in the office and it also boost productivity in any given sector.

                                                            Rewards is likened to what we call incentives given to some individuals as a reward for a job well done or hard work. Benefits are the things attached to a job when you’re employed, there are many kinds of rewards and benefits, for instance, rewards basically have to do with something that motivates someone but it might not enshrined in the organizational structure or employees conditions of service but it’s also part and parcel of what boost motivational workforce to an extent, so rewards and benefits goes together. There are different types of reward, for instance, after a successful completion of a job and your boss taps you at the back and says take a day or two off for a job well done, or gives you a lunch treat while in some organized sectors an employee birthday can be celebrated by management because of his/her impact in the organization and also there can be things like annual dinner where every employee comes with his/her family to have a nice time and this builds a bond and makes the workplace like a family and there are incentives in such dinner parties like raffle draws where employees win cash prizes, cars and all expense paid trips to foreign countries, etc. benefits are things we know that are attached to the job like health, lunch, housing, car benefits, etc which brings about motivation. When there is no reward or benefit there tends to be lack of motivation in the organization.

Aside that, I am a man that loves sports a lot, if an organization pays for the gym quarterly or yearly it will motivate me as well.

Money cannot be ruled out because we work for the money but for me personally, I am not of the opinion that money must be a factor that actually motivates me, there are other things the management can put in place that can motivate me. Just like I said earlier, a day or two off motivates me after putting in so much add work, activities like raffle draws, and sporting activities motivates me so, it mustn’t be money and the so-called pickup also motivates me and gives me this sense of belonging that the organization cares and it will reduce my transport burden.

Rewards are benefits are ingredients in every sector that must be alive, it brings about productivity and competitiveness among employees which causes personal development so as to effectively carry out the task at hand and it yields good productivity.

Some incentives given to you like welfare packages in the area of health, you can see so many discrepancies, in an organized sector, whether the superior or subordinate, they are all placed in the same HMO, which gives them a sense a belonging and discrepancies should not be brought to health issues, the best hospitals are what staff uses in an organized sector and the feeling of being loved by your organization makes room for more productivity. Imagine the General Manager of an organization and the least staff using the same hospital and have the same doctor, it gives you motivation, unlike when the superiors uses the best hospitals and the subordinate uses a lesser hospital, which demoralizes especially for us that are in the health insurance sector. What stops an organization to say to that staff that puts in so much to say take a day or two off, and such rewards go along way. For me as an individual, the nature of my job is very demanding as health insurance personnel, and if such incentives are not put in place, it kills my morale and aside that there should be departmental activities that creates relationships and build bonds among staff and it also impacts motivation greatly too.
                                                                      </p>

                                                                        <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
                                                                          <p>
                                                                            If I am given the opportunity in an higher position in NHIS to change things, firstly I will have to get the foundation right, the things that needs to be in the environment has to be put in place, constant power supply is a key and important role in productivity, firstly, the power has to be put in place because when there is no power, there tends to be lose of work or manpower, so the power sector has to be a key thing, I have to get the environment right, the environment has to be desirable for employee to work, if the environment is not desirable for an employee to work, definitely the environment will also affect productivity. Then the facilities which they have to use for work, as a staff, you can’t leave your office to walk down miles to make photocopy or print a job, all these things have to be in place. So, the organization needs to be put in a right state first.  The office also needs necessary things like water dispenser, because after a hard day’s work, an employee will feel tasty, even things like snacks, tea/coffee, will help any fatigued employee and rest for like 5 to 10 minutes watching television to be abreast with current happenings, all these things need to be in place to boost motivation. Now aside all these things, we have to put the health sector right, I will make sure that both superior and subordinate staff within the ramification of the system gets the best of the health sector, there should be no disintegration, discrimination or discrepancies, everyone should get the best health care services which will boost more productivity. Besides the health insurance scheme, the right stipend, training at the right time and work description all have to be put in place, there should be no duplication of work which causes inefficiency and low productivity. I will bring about the welfarism package, as earlier mentioned the pickup, nothing stops an organization from getting a bus for the picking up and dropping off of employees, so long as the employee can meet up and enter the bus at the specified time, which goes a long way to motivate the staff. Sensitive trainings will be given to employees that will meet best global standards and that will fit their job descriptions, that aside, organization of parties, end of year activities, raffle draws, etc when it comes to play, it will boost motivation. Then the benefits that goes with it, this benefits should be given as at when due and should go in consonance with the job. A pat at the back will go a long way too. Leadership style matters hugely too, if the boss is bossy it will kill productivity but a friendly leader makes room for productivity. 
                                                                          </p>

                                                                      </div>
