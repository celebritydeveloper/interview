                    Thank you very much. First question is, how does work environment affect productivity generally?

              <p>
                    It affects greatly too. Especially when you’re working with government agencies were the decisions and policies of government affects productivity either negatively or positively. Once an environment is not stable, it can’t bring out the best in you, so it will definitely affect the staff.

              <p>
                    Thank you very much, we move on to the next question, will your work place environment looking at NHIS have any impact on your productivity?

              <p>
                    I think it’s same as the general, but on my organization the NHIS there are some little things that are needed to be put in place. There are some equipment we need to work with which is not available at the moment, if they become available it will help us to do our work faster and better thereby spurring our staff to be more productive. Also, the conduciveness of the environment is a key factor.

              <p>
                    It will definitely affect productivity, it is what we call the ultimate motivating factor, its what everybody waits for you can’t be working for years without promotion, your looking forward to it because with it comes a lot of other things, so it definitely affects it.
              </p>

              <p>
                    Yes, promotion will definitely have a positive effect, it helps you move forward in hierarchy, you have more additional responsibility, higher respect and honour with increase in grade, salary and allowances. Its like the real motivating factor that pushes on to continue to put in your best as you’re promoted, this is an avenue for you to still show more of whatever skill you might have acquired over the years to do better, bringing out your best on doing better will help the organization as well. So, promotion is just like a reward everyone waits for.

              <p>
                    In other words, when workers are promoted as at when due they tend to perform better, so, how will you now rate the promotion in NHIS, does it come as at when due, is it anyway affecting workers when it doesn’t come, does productivity reduces, does performance reduces?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
              <p>
                    Over the years in NHIS, promotion did not come as at when due, which actually affected the morale of the staff because it was really demoralizing, that you’ve been working so many other years, but when you compare yourself with others working in other organizations, you’ll now be wondering that I’ve been working for 3-5 years and others that have worked for 2years have moved up, it really demoralizes, so for NHIS that has not been regular, but as soon as the promotion came, we could see the difference, staff were happy, they saw it as another opportunity to put in more and perform better, even going as far as putting in personal sacrifices as well, because they could see that they are heading somewhere and the organization too has their interest at heart as well. If you really want to look at it, from the past experience when there was no promotion and up till the time promotion came, you could see that it made a lot of difference, it will boost the morale of the staff and also increase the allowances and other pay which will make the staff to put in his or her best.

              <p>
                    Thank you very much, can you explain the lack of promotion on your own motivational level personally?
              </p>

              <p>
                    Just as I said, the time when the promotion was supposed to come and did not come, it was demoralizing, and we saw ourselves as not been significant enough, that management doesn’t care about us, and then we were not able to really achieve what we want, it also affected the organizational goal. When staff couldn’t achieve their own task given to them by the organization it affects the goals of the organization. That’s how it affected me when the promotion did not come as at when due.

                        To what extent are NHIS workers satisfied with their jobs?

                  <p>
                        For NHIS let me say we are not satisfied with our job, just like I said, those things that are supposed to be in place are not there and those things are supposed to stimulate self-development, create interest in the job, also initiate incentives and it will minimize discontent and unrest and then also attract capable individual, necessitate logical training for advancement, and then also forms an effective loyalty and cooperation. So, when you’re not satisfied with what you’re doing then all those things won’t come up.

                                                Yes, it is going to have a negative impact, I will not be able to put in my best at work, if you come to work and there is not power supply, you can’t use the convenience, you don’t have a laptop to work with, the office is not connected to the internet and all those things that will really make you satisfied as in when coming to work with the mindset that all these things are on ground, it makes you happy but when they are not there, it brings out this kind of negative energy and when you’re not satisfied it will definitely affect your motivation level and it will also productivity. And vice versa if the needed facilities are been put in place.

                                                        I think we already have some of the answer based on what we have discussed previously, first of all seeing the staff as what makes the organization so, the staff should be valued and when someone is valued you place the person in a high esteem, and also the organization should try and provide all the other facilities I mentioned earlier that are lacking, create an enabling work environment. Also, salaries should be reviewed due to the standard of living in our country so that people will not use office hours to be doing personal stuff and other allowances should be reviewed and paid as at when due, the content of training should be improved upon so as for us to be up to speed with current modern practices and be able to compete with other organization. The organization should also review its mandate and see how staff will be able to achieve that and make us to have the positive effect we are suppose to have in the society. All these will go a long way to make other staff and myself to be satisfied.

Health scheme is also a good reward as well, where the organization also contributes to take care of you and your family.

But I think before any monetary incentive is given there is supposed to be a kind of recognition first, so I believe one cannot go without the other.

Things that affect life generally, when you see they are having positive impact on you, it may not be inside the office, but such things will spur you on.

So, to some extent, it will still spur me on to do more, but maybe the monetary incentive would have done more.

If things are done properly and facilities are been provided for effective service delivery and if people that are supposed to provide these facilities are not self-centre and have the organization’s interest at heart, we won’t have problem with lack of facilities. Corruption, greediness and self-centredness should be fought against in the public sector, so as for people to think about the organizations more than themselves. If we have a very conducive working environment it will motivate staff more and the other things we have talked about like reward and benefit, promotion and allowances to be paid as at when due will also motivate workers. But the absence of it demotivates staff and makes them unhappy.
